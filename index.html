<p>FUCK MAN it's back to the daily grind of 9-5 office labor. Good news is that Dheeru apparently moved the presentation to next Wednesday, giving me an extra 8 days!! Guess he read my mind lol. For lunch I had lunch with the boiz (Sevan, Patrick, Carlos) at Chick-Fil-A. It's only been a few weeks but man I've been craving some good ass junk food chicken sandwich. Wait, I just had Popeyes on Fridayâ€¦ I had brought the box of rose cakes to work, and it went pretty <em>fast</em>... a lot of the guys were here at work, including Eugene and Vishal.</p>
<p>Afterwork it was back to grinding on my Khali. I was actually able to kill NLotus and Ndamien without much struggle.</p>
<h3 id="31-jul">31-Jul</h3>
<p>Another reset day, meaning I get to kill Lomien for the 2nd day in a row. Got lucky again with my lotus cores (3 this week, 3 last week), meaning I have enough for 3 pieces. Sadly this means I have a long way to go in terms of grinding weeklies.</p>
<h2 id="august"><strong>August</strong></h2>
<h3 id="aug-1">Aug 1</h3>
<p>Had our monthly Akhil happy hour meeting. Basically talked shit for an hour :D. Had a chorizo breakfast burrito from the food truck, which was quite filling.</p>
<h3 id="aug-2">Aug 2</h3>
<p>Had my 1:1 with Akhil today morning, first in like a month. Afterwords I "worked" until early afternoon, at which point I stopped even pretending to be productive. For lunch I had teriyaki chicken from the mall food court. It's eerily similar to old place which got shut down, Sarku or whatever it was called.</p>
<h3 id="aug-3">Aug 3</h3>
<p>First time in a while I got to truly sleep in! Woke up at 1:30 PM (classic) to the caucophony of Mom's Chinese friends from Vancouver (and her friends) visiting our house. We had a large group lunch at Wolf Creek where we ordered a bunch of appetizers (and two pizzas) which we shared Chinese dining-style. I was careful not to eat too much since there's gonna be a large dinner later on for Daniel's b-day.</p>
<p>I didn't have a gift for Daniel by the time I arrived at Dad's place, but I had a plan in mind. My plan is to give him my old Razer Blade laptop, which still functions flawlessly minus the battery. But I have to make him wait a week LOL. We had dinner at Buca Di Beppo, where Daniel was talking nonstop about his new favorite game, Darkest Dungeon. The pasta was pretty good this time?? Can't deny it's overpriced, though.</p>
<h3 id="aug-6">Aug 6</h3>
<p>Finally got my Khali to Cernium in Maplestory. I guess it's my first ever character to reach Grandis! The mobs are infuriatingly hard to one-shot though, even after dumping hella sacred symbols from the event coupons. I guess I'll suck it up, because the rates are way too good to pass up. This might be the fastest I've ever progressed a character? 1-260 in a week and a half is kinda nuts.</p>
<h3 id="aug-7">Aug 7</h3>
<p>Went to Tokai with Sevan, Patrick, and VIshal. The 3-item bento box <em>always</em> satisfies. We caught Armen and co. heading over to Apola Greek restaurant and paid them a visit afterwards LOL.</p>
<h3 id="aug-8">Aug 8</h3>
<p>Met the new guy at work (Gary) who is the latest addition to Akhil's team. We had a huge team lunch downstairs at the bistro. I had perhaps the worst Pad Thai rendition of all time for lunch. Nothing about it was right lmao! Good itnroduction to the bistro food for Gary, I guess. Later on, I peeped in the first 45ish minutes of the interns' final presentations. I caught Vishal's intern's AI presentation which was cool I guess. Audio was jank though. Bharat decided to join us for TT today, and BOI was he rusty. Dude forgot how to use his legs after not having played for over a year HAHA.</p>
<p>Finally pulled the trigger and ordered the ROG Ally X Windows handheld gaming PC after noticing it was finally in stock today!
