### 30-Jul
FUCK MAN it's back to the daily grind of 9-5 office labor. Good news is that Dheeru apparently moved the presentation to next Wednesday, giving me an extra 8 days!! Guess he read my mind lol. For lunch I had lunch with the boiz (Sevan, Patrick, Carlos) at Chick-Fil-A. It's only been a few weeks but man I've been craving some good ass junk food chicken sandwich. Wait, I just had Popeyes on Fridayâ€¦ I had brought the box of rose cakes to work, and it went pretty *fast*... a lot of the guys were here at work, including Eugene and Vishal.

Afterwork it was back to grinding on my Khali. I was actually able to kill NLotus and Ndamien without much struggle.

### 31-Jul
Another reset day, meaning I get to kill Lomien for the 2nd day in a row. Got lucky again with my lotus cores (3 this week, 3 last week), meaning I have enough for 3 pieces. Sadly this means I have a long way to go in terms of grinding weeklies.

Had our monthly Akhil happy hour meeting. Basically talked shit for an hour :D. Had a chorizo breakfast burrito from the food truck, which was quite filling.

### Aug 2
Had my 1:1 with Akhil today morning, first in like a month. Afterwords I "worked" until early afternoon, at which point I stopped even pretending to be productive. For lunch I had teriyaki chicken from the mall food court. It's eerily similar to old place which got shut down, Sarku or whatever it was called.
